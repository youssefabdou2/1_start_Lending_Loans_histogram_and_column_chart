LendingTree is a peer-to-peer lending platform that allows individuals to lend to other individuals. Each row in the dataset represents a unique loan, and each column provides information about the borrower and the loan details, such as job title, annual income, loan amount, and paid interest.

ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to perform a statistical analysis on the existing loans to identify the risk level of each loan and to determine which factors affect that risk. This analysis will help potential lenders better understand the risks involved before committing to lending decisions.

ðŸ“Š Data Description

The dataset includes the following key columns:

Job Title: The occupation of the borrower.

Annual Income: The borrower's yearly income.

Loan Amount: The principal amount of the loan.

Homeownership: The borrower's homeownership status (Rent, Mortgage, Home).

Loan Grade: A quality score assigned to each loan based on the borrower's credit history.

Paid Interest: The amount of interest paid back to the lender (Column P).

ðŸ”Ž Statistical Analysis

We perform the following descriptive statistics:

Mean: The average paid interest, providing a central tendency of returns.

Median: The midpoint of paid interest values, indicating typical returns.

Percentiles (10th, 50th, 99th): Useful for understanding the spread and outliers in paid interest.

Mode of Homeownership: Identifies the most common type of homeownership among borrowers.

These analyses help to:

Understand average returns from paid interest.

Identify extreme cases in the dataset (e.g., top 1% interest returns).

Assess collateral through homeownership data.

ðŸ“ˆ Data Visualization

We use the following visualizations to better interpret the data:

Histogram of Paid Interest: To see the distribution of interest payments.

Column Chart of Loan Grades: To understand the distribution of loan grades and their associated risks.
